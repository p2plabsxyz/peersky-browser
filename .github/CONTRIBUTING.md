## AI Usage Policy

### Purpose

At Peersky, we encourage contributors to use AI tools to improve efficiency and productivity. AI can be valuable for research, drafting, refactoring, and exploring ideas.
However, AI is an assistive tool. It does not replace professional skill, judgment, or accountability.

### Expectations

All AI-generated output must be thoroughly reviewed and fully understood before submission. Contributors are responsible for every line of code they commit, regardless of how it was produced.
If you cannot clearly explain, modify, or defend the code without AI assistance, it should not be submitted.
We expect contributors to already possess the skills required to complete tasks independently. AI should enhance your workflow, not compensate for gaps in knowledge or experience.

### Quality & Responsibility

Do not blindly accept AI output. Evaluate it for correctness, security, performance, and alignment with the project architecture.
Do not share confidential or sensitive information with AI tools.
Peersky collaborates with skilled professionals. We are not outsourcing judgment to automated systems.
Use AI thoughtfully. Maintain high standards. Take full ownership of your work.
